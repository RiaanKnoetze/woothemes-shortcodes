== Description ==

WooThemes uses WooFramework which comes with loads of shortcodes, if you have used the theme for a while you may have used the 
shortcodes in your pages. Switching over to another theme becomes difficult as the shortcodes aren't supported in a non WooThemes theme. 
With the help of this plugin easily switch to a non WooThemes theme but retain the framework shortcodes.

Before installing this plugin you need to first deactivate the Woothemes theme and activate any other theme,
and then install and activate this plugin.

== Disclaimer ==

Please note this is not an official WooThemes plugin. I have created this plugin
with the hope that it will help someone switch to another theme like Storefront that doesn't
have shortcodes that are provided by a WooThemes theme. All the copyrights and

== Installation ==

1. Upload to the plugins directory
